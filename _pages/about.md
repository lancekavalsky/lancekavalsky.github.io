I'm a postdoctoral researcher in [Prof. Manos Mavrikakis's](https://manos.engr.wisc.edu/) group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Here, I am using first-principles computation to better understand active site formation for heterogeneous catalytic interfaces.

Previously, I earned my PhD under the guidance of [Prof. Venkatasubramanian Viswanathan](https://eeg.engin.umich.edu/) in the department of Mechanical Engineering at University of Michigan. My research broadly centered around first-principles modeling of electrochemical systems and using machine learning to guide autonomous materials discovery. 

I'm also a developer of [*Autocat*](https://aced-differentiate.github.io/auto_cat/), an open-source python software that provides tools to support electrocatalytic structure generation for first principles simulation. Additionally, it provides tools to support closed-loop computational searches for electrocatalyst discovery.

# About this site
This website is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub Pages. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
